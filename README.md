# SmartEverything ST LSM9DS1  3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope, 3D magnetometer

---
This is a library for the ST LSM9DS1 component.

The LSM9DS1 is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor, a 3D
digital angular rate sensor, and a 3D digital magnetic sensor.

The LSM9DS1 has a linear acceleration full scale of ±2g/±4g/±8/±16 g, a
magnetic field full scale of ±4/±8/±12/±16 gauss and an angular rate of
±245/±500/±2000 dps.

Host control and result reading is performed using an I2C interface, no extra pin are required.

It was principally designed to work with the SmartEverything board, but could
be easily adapt and use on every Arduino and Arduino Certified boards.
